Syncing Repositories:

Create an empty repository on github account, these are called 'Remotes'
You can 'Push' and 'Pull' data to the remote

Commits that are already on the server, they don't get sent again.

Don't initialize 'Readme' when pushing to the remote

commands: 
git remote
git remote add origin git@github.com:Gicela/reflections.git
git remote (shows the remote)
git remote - v
origin git@github.com:Gicela/reflections.git (fetch)
origin git@github.com:Gicela/reflections.git (pull)

git push origin master (copies all the commits on local master)
